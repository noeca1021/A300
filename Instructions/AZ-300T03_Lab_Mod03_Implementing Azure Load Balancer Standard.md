## Exercise 1: Implement inbound load balancing and NAT by using Azure Load Balancer Standard 
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Deploy Azure VMs in an availability set by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. Create an instance of Azure Load Balancer Standard

1. Create a load balancing rule of Azure Load Balancer Standard

1. Create a NAT rule of Azure Load Balancer Standard

1. Test functionality of Azure Load Balancer Standard


#### Task 1: Deploy Azure VMs in an availability set by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. From the lab virtual machine, start Microsoft Edge and browse to the Azure portal at [**http://portal.azure.com**](http://portal.azure.com) and sign in by using the Microsoft account that has the Owner role in the target Azure subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, in the Microsoft Edge window, start a **Bash** session within the **Cloud Shell**. 

1. If you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, configure storage using the following settings:

    - Subsciption: the name of the target Azure subscription

    - Cloud Shell region: the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the lab location

    - Resource group: the name of a new resource group **az3000800-LabRG**

    - Storage account: a name of a new storage account

    - File share: a name of a new file share

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, create a resource groups by running (replace the `<Azure region>` placeholder with the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the lab location)

   ```
   az group create --name az3000801-LabRG --location <Azure region>
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the Azure Resource Manager template **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T03\\Module_03\\azuredeploy0801.json** into the home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the parameter file **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T03\\Module_03\\azuredeploy0801.parameters.json** into the home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, deploy a pair of Azure VMs hosting Windows Server 2016 Datacenter by running:

   ```
   az group deployment create --resource-group az3000801-LabRG --template-file azuredeploy0801.json --parameters @azuredeploy0801.parameters.json
