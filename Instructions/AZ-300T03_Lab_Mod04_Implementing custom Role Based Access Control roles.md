# Lab: Implementing custom Role Based Access Control (RBAC) roles
  
### Scenario
  
Adatum Corporation wants to implement custom RBAC roles to delegate permissions to start and stop (deallocate) Azure VMs.


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-  Define a custom RBAC role 

-  Assign a custom RBAC role

### Lab Setup
  
Estimated Time: 30 minutes

User Name: **Student**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**


## Exercise 1: Define a custom RBAC role
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. Identify actions to delegate via RBAC

1. Create a custom RBAC role in an Azure AD tenant


#### Task 1: Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. From the lab virtual machine, start Microsoft Edge and browse to the Azure portal at [**http://portal.azure.com**](http://portal.azure.com) and sign in by using the Microsoft account that has the Owner role in the target Azure subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, in the Microsoft Edge window, start a **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell**. 

1. If you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, configure storage using the following settings:

    - Subsciption: the name of the target Azure subscription

    - Cloud Shell region: the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the lab location

    - Resource group: the name of a new resource group **az3000900-LabRG**

    - Storage account: a name of a new storage account

    - File share: a name of a new file share

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, create a resource groups by running (replace the `<Azure region>` placeholder with the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the lab location)

   ```
   New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name az3000901-LabRG -Location <Azure region>
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the Azure Resource Manager template **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T03\\Module_04\\azuredeploy09.json** into the home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the parameter file **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T03\\Module_04\\azuredeploy09.parameters.json** into the home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, deploy an Azure VM hosting Ubuntu by running:

   ```
   New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName az3000901-LabRG -TemplateFile azuredeploy09.json -TemplateParameterFile azuredeploy09.parameters.json
   ```

    > **Note**: Do not wait for the deployment to complete but instead proceed to the next task. 

1. In the Azure portal, close the Cloud Shell pane.


#### Task 2: Identify actions to delegate via RBAC

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **az3000901-LabRG** blade.

1. On the **az3000901-LabRG** blade, click **Access Control (IAM)**.

1. On the **az3000901-LabRG - Access Control (IAM)** blade, click **Roles**.

1. On the **Roles** blade, click **Owner**.

1. On the **Owner** blade, click **Permissions**.

1. On the **Permissions (preview)** blade, click **Microsoft Compute**.

1. On the **Microsoft Compute** blade, click **Virtual machines**.

1. On the **Virtual Machines** blade, review the list of management actions that can be delegated through RBAC. Note that they include the **Deallocate Virtual Machine** and **Start Virtual Machine** actions.


#### Task 3: Create a custom RBAC role in an Azure AD tenant

1. On the lab computer, open the file **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T03\\Module_04\\customRoleDefinition09.json** and review its content:

   ```
   {
      "Name": "Virtual Machine Operator (Custom)",
      "Id": null,
      "IsCustom": true,
      "Description": "Allows to start and stop (deallocate) Azure VMs",
      "Actions": [
          "Microsoft.Compute/*/read",
          "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/deallocate/action",
          "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/start/action"
      ],
      "NotActions": [
      ],
      "AssignableScopes": [
          "/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
      ]
   }
   ```

1. In the Azure portal, in the Microsoft Edge window, start a **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell**. 

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the Azure Resource Manager template **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T03\\Module_04\\customRoleDefinition09.json** into the home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to replace the **$SUBSCRIPTION\_ID** placeholder with the ID value of the Azure subscription:

   ```
   $subscription_id = (Get-AzureRmSubscription).Id
   (Get-Content -Path $HOME/customRoleDefinition09.json) -Replace 'SUBSCRIPTION_ID', "$subscription_id" | Set-Content -Path $HOME/customRoleDefinition09.json
   ```
 
1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the custom role definition:

   ```
   New-AzureRmRoleDefinition -InputFile $HOME/customRoleDefinition09.json
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to verify that the role was created successfully:

   ```
   Get-AzureRmRoleDefinition -Name 'Virtual Machine Operator (Custom)'
   ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.


> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have defined a custom RBAC role


## Exercise 2: Assign and test a custom RBAC role
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create an Azure AD user

1. Create an RBAC role assignment

1. Test the RBAC role assignment


#### Task 1: Create an Azure AD user

1. In the Azure portal, in the Microsoft Edge window, start a **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell**. 

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to identify the Azure AD DNS domain name:

   ```
   $domainName = ((Get-AzureAdTenantDetail).VerifiedDomains)[0].Name
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new Azure AD user:

   ```
   $passwordProfile = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.PasswordProfile
   $passwordProfile.Password = 'Pa55w.rd1234'
   $passwordProfile.ForceChangePasswordNextLogin = $false
   New-AzureADUser -AccountEnabled $true -DisplayName 'lab user0901' -PasswordProfile $passwordProfile -MailNickName 'labuser0901' -UserPrincipalName "labuser0901@$domainName"
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to identify the user principal name of the newly created Azure AD user:

   ```
   (Get-AzureADUser -Filter "MailNickName eq 'labuser0901'").UserPrincipalName
   ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.


#### Task 2: Create an RBAC role assignment
 
1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **az3000901-LabRG** blade.

1. On the **az3000901-LabRG** blade, click **Access Control (IAM)**.

1. On the **az3000901-LabRG - Access Control (IAM)** blade, click **+ Add** and select the **Add role assignment** option.

1. On the **Add role assignment** blade, specify the following settings and click **Save**:

    - Role: **Virtual Machine Operator (Custom)**

    - Assign access to: **Azure AD user, group, or application**

    - Select: **lab user0901**


#### Task 3: Test the RBAC role assignment

1. Start a new in-private Microsoft Edge window, browse to the Azure portal at [**http://portal.azure.com**](http://portal.azure.com) and sign in by using the newly created user account:

    - Username: the user principal name you identified in the first task of this exercise

    - Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Resource groups** blade. Note that you are not able to see any resource groups. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **All resources** blade. Note that you are able to see only the **az3000901-vm** and its managed disk.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **az3000901-vm** blade. Try restarting the virtual machine. Review the error message in the notification area and note that this action failed because the current user is not authorized to carry it out.

1. Stop the virtual machine and verify that the action completed successfully.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have assigned and tested a custom RBAC role
