1. In the Azure portal, in the Microsoft Edge window, start a **Bash** session within the **Cloud Shell**. 

1. If you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, configure storage using the following settings:

    - Subsciption: the name of the target Azure subscription

    - Cloud Shell region: the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the lab location

    - Resource group: the name of a new resource group **az3000400-LabRG**

    - Storage account: a name of a new storage account

    - File share: a name of a new file share

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, create two resource groups by running (replace the `<Azure region>` placeholder with the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the lab location)

   ```
   az group create --resource-group az3000401-LabRG --location <Azure region>
   az group create --resource-group az3000402-LabRG --location <Azure region>
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the first Azure Resource Manager template **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T02\\Module_03\\azuredeploy0401.json** into the home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the parameter file **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T02\\Module_03\\azuredeploy04.parameters.json** into the home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, deploy the two Azure VMs hosting Windows Server 2016 Datacenter into the first virtual network by running:

   ```
   az group deployment create --resource-group az3000401-LabRG --template-file azuredeploy0401.json --parameters @azuredeploy04.parameters.json
   ```

    > **Note**: Do not wait for the deployment to complete but proceed to the next task.


#### Task 1: Create the second Azure virtual network environment by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the second Azure Resource Manager template **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T02\\Module_03\\azuredeploy0402.json** into the home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, deploy an Azure VM hosting Windows Server 2016 Datacenter into the second virtual network by running:

   ```
   az group deployment create --resource-group az3000402-LabRG --template-file azuredeploy0402.json --parameters @azuredeploy04.parameters.json
   ```

    > **Note**: The second template uses the same parameter file.
