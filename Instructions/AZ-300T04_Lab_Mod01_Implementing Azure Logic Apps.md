### Lab Setup
  
Estimated Time: 45 minutes

User Name: **Student**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**


## Exercise 1: Set up the lab environment that consists of an Azure storage account and an Azure logic app 
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create an Azure storage account

1. Create an Azure logic app 

1. Create an Azure AD service principal 

1. Assign the Reader role to the Azure AD service principal 

1. Register the Microsoft.EventGrid resource provider 


#### Task 1: Create a storage account in Azure

1. From the lab virtual machine, start Microsoft Edge and browse to the Azure portal at [**http://portal.azure.com**](http://portal.azure.com) and sign in by using the Microsoft account that has the Owner role in the target Azure subscription.
  
1. From Azure Portal, create a new storage account with the following settings: 

    - Subscription: the name of the target Azure subscription

    - Resource group: a new resource group named **az3000701-LabRG**

    - Storage account name: any valid, unique name between 3 and 24 characters consisting of lowercase letters and digits

    - Location: the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the lab location

    - Performance: **Standard**

    - Account kind: **Storage (general purpose v1)**

    - Replication: **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**

    - Secure transfer required: **Enabled**

    - Virtual network: **All networks**

    - Hierarchical namespace: **Disabled**

    > **Note**: Do not wait for the deployment to complete but instead proceed to the next task. 


#### Task 2: Create an Azure logic app 
 
1. From Azure Portal, create an instance of **Logic App** with the following settings:

    - Name: **logicapp3000701**

    - Subscription: the name of the target Azure subscription

    - Resource group: the name of a new resource group **az3000702-LabRG**

    - Location: the same Azure region into which you deployed the storage account in the previous task

    - Log Analytics: **Off**

1. Wait until the vault is provisioned. This will take about a minute. 


#### Task 3: Create an Azure AD service principal 

1. In the Azure portal, in the Microsoft Edge window, start a **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell**. 

1. If you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, configure storage using the following settings:

    - Subsciption: the name of the target Azure subscription

    - Cloud Shell region: the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the lab location

    - Resource group: the name of a new resource group **az3000700-LabRG**

    - Storage account: a name of a new storage account

    - File share: a name of a new file share

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new Azure AD application that you will associate with the service principal you create in the subsequent steps of this task:

   ```pwsh
   $password = 'Pa55w.rd1234'
   $securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -Force -AsPlainText -String $password
   $aadApp30007 = New-AzADApplication -DisplayName 'aadApp30007' -HomePage 'http://aadApp30007' -IdentifierUris 'http://aadApp30007' -Password $securePassword
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new Azure AD service principal associated with the application you created in the previous step:

   ```pwsh
   New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $aadApp30007.ApplicationId.Guid
   ```

1. In the output of the **New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal** command, note the value of the **ApplicationId** property. You will need this in the next exercise of this lab.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to identify the value of the **Id** property of the current Azure subscription and the value of the **TenantId** property of the Azure AD tenant associated with that subscription (you will also need them in the next exercise of this lab):

   ```pwsh
   Get-AzSubscription
   ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.


#### Task 4: Assign the Reader role to the Azure AD service principal 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade displaying properties of your Azure subscription. 

1. On the Azure subscription blade, click **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Assign the **Reader** role within the scope of the Azure subscription to the **aadApp30007** service principal.


#### Task 5: Register the Microsoft.EventGrid resource provider

1. In the Azure portal, in the Microsoft Edge window, reopen the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell**. 

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to register the Microsoft.EventGrid resource provider:

   ```pwsh
   Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.EventGrid
   ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.


> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created a storage account, a logic app that you will configure in the next exercise of this lab, and an Azure AD service principal that you will reference during that configuration.


## Exercise 2: Configure Azure logic app to monitor changes to a resource group.
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Add a trigger to the Azure logic app

1. Add an action to the Azure logic app

1. Identify the callback URL of the Azure logic app

1. Configure an event subscription

1. Test the logic app


#### Task 1: Add a trigger to the Azure logic app

1. In the the Azure portal, navigate to the **Logic App Designer** blade of the newly provisioned Azure logic app.

1. On the configuration blade, set the **Secure transfer required** setting to **Disabled**

1. Navigate to the **logicapp3000701** blade, click **Refresh**, and note that the **Runs history** includes the entry corresponding to configuration change of the Azure storage account.

1. Navigate to the inbox of the email account you configured in this exercise and verify that includes an email generated by the logic app.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have configured an Azure logic app to monitor changes to a resource group.


## Exercise 3: Remove lab resources

#### Task 1: Open Cloud Shell

1. At the top of the portal, click the **Cloud Shell** icon to open the Cloud Shell pane.

1. If needed, switch to the Bash shell session by using the drop down list in the upper left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.

1. At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, type in the following command and press **Enter** to list all resource groups you created in this lab:

   ```
   az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az30007')]".name --output tsv
   ```

1. Verify that the output contains only the resource groups you created in this lab. These groups will be deleted in the next task.

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1. At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, type in the following command and press **Enter** to delete the resource groups you created in this lab
